# Music Genre Classification

This project includes classifiers for music genres. The dataset is organized into the `dataset` directory, which contains ten subdirectories with different music genre, each with 50 WAV files. The project utilizes three different classification models and employs five feature extraction methods.

## Audio Features Used
1. **Mel-Spectrogram**
2. **Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC)**
3. **Spectral Contrast**  
4. **Zero Crossing Rate**
5. **Chroma STFT**

## Classification Models
1. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
2. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
3. **Random Forest**


## Usage

1. Clone or download this project.
2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. Run the main script:
    ```
    python main.py
    ```
4. Customize the classifier and feature extraction method to use in the 'Start Training' section.
